// import Action from "./Action";
// import BotState from "./Botstate";

// export default interface Factor {
//     id: string //to determine if factors are the same factor
//     effectedBy(action: Action): boolean
//     getValue(bot: BotState): any
// }

//Best Practice:

// for progress Goals: Fullfillement = -Effort

// Effort evaluation:
// for Actions Effort requirements + effort execution
// on multiple options choose lower effort one -> Actions improveing worse option don't effect Effort -> faster one will be chosen

// chance of succes like drop rates just include in effort (effort/chance of success, maybe * riskwillingness)

// chance of loosing to death -> idk how to handle that

// Still need some best Practice for time management -> shortterm, longterm effects
